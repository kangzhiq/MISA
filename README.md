Official PyTorch implementation of our ICLR 2025 paper for general continual learning "[Advancing Prompt-Based Methods for Replay-Independent General Continual Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=V6uxd8MEqw)". 

Our proposed MISA（**M**ask and **I**nitial-**S**ession **A**daptation) consists of the forgetting-aware initial session adaptation and the non-parametric logit mask to facilitate general continual learning, as presented in the following figure:

## How to run MISA?

### Build the conda environment

Please make sure that necessary packages in the environment.yml file are available.

### Two stage of MISA


#### Initial session adaptation

To warm up the prompt parameters by our initial session adaptation and our proposed forgetting-aware minimization, please run:

    . scripts/misa_fam.sh

The warmed-up prompts will be stored in the pretrained_prompt/ folder.

We provide the pretrained prompt parameters in the pretrained_prompt/ folder to faciliate the reproduction of our results.

#### Training on downstram dataset and test

To test different methods with different datasets, simply run the corresponding script with the specific dataset entry in the file:

    . scripts/misa.sh

## Acknolegment
This implementation is developed based on the source code of [MVP](https://github.com/KHU-AGI/Si-Blurry/tree/main).
